# JS Chat

A real-time, single-forum chat application built with **React** and **Express.js**.  
It uses stateless **JWT** sessions, polls the server every few seconds for new data, and stores messages in **MongoDB**. The UI is a responsive SPA designed with accessibility and internationalisation (i18n) in mind.
